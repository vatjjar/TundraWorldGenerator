Tundra world generator tools aim to be a set of python scripts for easy
procedural generation of terrains and its components to be run with
realXtend Tundra client.

Currently provided generator modules:

  - TerrainGenerator.py: A set of tools for generating heightmaps
  and textures for shader based terrain mapping. See python module
  for further documentation and examples.

  - WorldGenerator.py: Overall control point for all individual generators.
  With this main application complete worlds can be built. One example
  implemented as a test case

  - TextureGenerator.py: A library of procedural algorithms for generation
  of texture maps. At the moment single color textures are supported.

  - MeshGenerator.py:

Currently provided support modules are:

  - TXMLOutput.py: A class for formatting TXML output stream for the
  generator

  - OgreXMLOutput.py:

Dependencies:

  - Python Imaging Library ( apt-get install python-imaging )
  - Python Noise ( pip install noise )
